    "c_{j,k} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_{i,j} - \\mu_j)(y_{i, k} - \\mu_k).\n",
    "$$ If we normalise this covariance by the standard deviaton of the two\n",
    "variables ($\\sigma_j, \\sigma_k$) then we recover Pearson’s correlation,\n",
    "often known as Pearson’s $\\rho$ (the Greek letter rho), $$\n",

    "$$ Computing the correlation between two values is a way to determine if\n",
    "the values have a relationship with each other.\n",

    "One of the problems of statistics, is that when we are working with\n",
    "small data, an apparant correlation might just be a statistical\n",
    "anomally, i.e. a conicidence, that arises just because the quantity of\n",
    "data we have collected is low. In mathematical statistics we make use of\n",
    "hypothesis testing to estimate if a given statistic is “statistically\n",

    "In classical hypothesis testing, we define a *null hypothesis*. This is\n",
    "a hypothesis that contradicts the idea we’re interested in. So for\n",
    "correlation analysis, the null hypothesis would be “there is no\n",
    "correlation between the features $i$ and $j$.” We then measure the $p$\n",

    "is low (typically below 0.05 or below 0.01 depending on how stringent we\n",
